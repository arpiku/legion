# Legion
So it's March 13 late night (1:45) project, let's start building my engineering assistant "Legion".
These are the capabilities that I want from some piece of code that repreents the value Legion:

- It helps me save time by helping me not needing to repeat keystrokes.
    - Macros will form part of it.
- Increase the fluidity of my work and ability to learn new stuff.
- This system will be a general "action" model - GAM.

## Current Vision and possible next steps:
    - This will be an OS wide utility.
    - It will store data, my actions, my history etc. 
    - There will be two other variants, LegionX and LegionR.

## The use experience I am looking for and foundational part of this software.
    - Terminal Integration of AI tools like ChatGPT etc.
    - Ability to do maximum amount of tasks with shortcuts, with a heavy focus on automatic information categorization 
    and retrievement.

## What is the goal and why do I build it?
    - The idea here mostly has to do with my personal need and want of a general piece of code that is like my "assistant".
    - It's not an OS, it's not a brand, it's compute and it's data that is mine and "lives" with me.
    - It should be transferable, it should be upgradable. It needs to be hardware agnostic (let's not focus too much on that in the begining).
    
## Yeah So work day log 
    - Things that annoy me (problems to solve).
        - repition of commands.
        - In ability to easily setup a workstation, in-availability of any automatic back up,
        reliance on branded software with varying UI, keyboard shorcuts, the information should be available in as few screens 
    as possible according to that scenario.
        - This means a pieace of code that runs on your phone, your laptop, your weird keyboard, it can mutate, it can transfer 
    to different states.

## Possible AGI Implementation: A mutable Neural Network that adapts ands grows and shrinks. 
    - You start with a neural network with say m input and n outputs, some function of inputs f(m*) = n*.
    now f = g(t).
    - So umm... yeah just thinking about it, I think we'd need a quantum computer to simulate it, nah at that point it would be life perhaps....lol
    - The neural network will need to be able to grow a symmetrically.
